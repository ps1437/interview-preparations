# üõ†Ô∏è Application Optimization Checklist

A structured guide to optimize performance across backend, frontend, database, and infrastructure.

---

## üì¶ Backend Optimization

* [ ] Use connection pooling (e.g., HikariCP in Spring Boot).
* [ ] Apply caching (e.g., Redis, in-memory caches) for frequently accessed data.
* [ ] Minimize expensive DB calls inside loops.
* [ ] Use asynchronous processing where applicable (`@Async`, `CompletableFuture`, etc.).
* [ ] Reduce memory footprint by using streams & pagination (e.g., Spring Data `Pageable`).
* [ ] Profile with tools like JProfiler, VisualVM.
* [ ] Reduce object creation inside hot loops (use object re-use/pooling if needed).

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Optimization

* [ ] Create indexes on frequently queried columns.
* [ ] Use query profilers (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`) to find slow queries.
* [ ] Avoid SELECT \* ‚Äî only fetch needed columns.
* [ ] Use batching for inserts/updates (e.g., `JdbcTemplate.batchUpdate()`).
* [ ] Archive old data and partition large tables.
* [ ] Use proper normalization but denormalize if needed for reads.
* [ ] Monitor DB connections and optimize timeouts.

---

## üíª Frontend Optimization

* [ ] Enable lazy loading for components and images.
* [ ] Use tree-shaking and code-splitting (Webpack/Next.js/React).
* [ ] Minify and compress JS/CSS/HTML.
* [ ] Optimize critical render path (LCP, FID, CLS metrics).
* [ ] Cache static assets with proper cache headers.
* [ ] Use CDN for assets.
* [ ] Avoid blocking synchronous scripts.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è DevOps / Infra Optimization

* [ ] Enable GZIP compression on web servers.
* [ ] Use CDN + edge caching (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront).
* [ ] Set up application-level metrics (Prometheus + Grafana).
* [ ] Use APM tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Elastic APM).
* [ ] Apply autoscaling (CPU/Mem-based).
* [ ] Optimize Docker images (multi-stage builds, minimal base images).
* [ ] Use environment-specific resource limits in K8s.

---

## üîê Security Optimizations

* [ ] Avoid loading secrets/configs into memory logs.
* [ ] Use secure headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).
* [ ] Rate limiting on public APIs.
* [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere with strong ciphers.
* [ ] Regularly audit dependencies (e.g., OWASP Dependency Check, Snyk).

---

## üîç Monitoring & Alerts

* [ ] Set up log aggregation (e.g., ELK, Loki, CloudWatch).
* [ ] Define alert thresholds for error rates, CPU/mem usage, latency.
* [ ] Monitor GC logs for memory leaks.
* [ ] Enable health checks (`/actuator/health`) and readiness probes.

---

## üìà Performance Testing

* [ ] Use JMeter, Gatling, or k6 for load testing.
* [ ] Test latency under high concurrency.
* [ ] Run chaos testing (e.g., Gremlin, Chaos Monkey).
* [ ] Stress test DB separately from APIs.

---

## üß™ Code-Level Optimizations

* [ ] Avoid nested loops and expensive operations (e.g., O(N^2) in hot paths).
* [ ] Leverage parallel streams cautiously with large data.
* [ ] Optimize string manipulations (use `StringBuilder` in loops).
* [ ] Profile memory usage with heap dump analysis.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist Before Release

* [ ] Load tested under expected traffic
* [ ] No high-severity security vulnerabilities
* [ ] No memory leaks detected in load test
* [ ] GC and heap usage within acceptable range
* [ ] DB and external services can scale with load
