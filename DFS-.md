In **LeetCode tree problems**, deciding whether to use **preorder**, **inorder**, or **postorder traversal** depends on the structure of the problem and the *order* in which you need to access the nodes.

Here’s a guide that breaks it down clearly by **when and why** you'd use each:

---

### ✅ **1. Preorder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)**

#### **When to use:**

* You need to **process or construct the root before its children**.
* Useful in:

  * **Cloning** a tree.
  * **Serializing/deserializing** a tree (e.g., [Leetcode 297](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)).
  * **Constructing** a binary tree from preorder + inorder.
  * **Finding path from root to a node**.

#### **Example Questions:**

* [Leetcode 144 – Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)
* [Leetcode 105 – Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)

---

### ✅ **2. Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)**

#### **When to use:**

* You need **sorted data** from a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**.
* You want to **find the kth smallest/largest** element in BST.
* You're working with **validating BSTs** or problems involving **BST properties**.

#### **Example Questions:**

* [Leetcode 94 – Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)
* [Leetcode 230 – Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)
* [Leetcode 98 – Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

---

### ✅ **3. Postorder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)**

#### **When to use:**

* You need to **process children before the parent**.
* Useful in:

  * **Deleting** a tree (freeing memory bottom-up).
  * **Evaluating expression trees**.
  * **Calculating subtree properties** (e.g., height, sum).
  * Bottom-up **DP on trees** (Dynamic Programming on Trees).

#### **Example Questions:**

* [Leetcode 145 – Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)
* [Leetcode 543 – Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)
* [Leetcode 124 – Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

### 🔁 Summary Table

| Use Case                                | Preferred Traversal | Reason                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Building a tree from preorder + inorder | **Preorder**        | Root node comes first             |
| BST problems like kth smallest          | **Inorder**         | BST yields sorted order           |
| Tree deletion / post-processing         | **Postorder**       | Process children first            |
| Cloning or serializing a tree           | **Preorder**        | Need to save root before children |
| Tree-based DP / max path sum            | **Postorder**       | Need results from children first  |
| Expression evaluation                   | **Postorder**       | Operands before operator          |
