 1. The problem involves processing a string \( s \) and handling multiple queries. Each query provides a substring of \( s \) defined by start and end indices, along with a number of allowed substitutions (\( subs \)). The task is to determine if the substring can be made into a palindrome with the given number of substitutions, and if so, return "1"; otherwise, return "0".

### Problem Breakdown
- **Input**:
  - \( s \): The input string (e.g., \( s = "cdecd" \)).
  - \( startIndex \): Array of start indices (e.g., \( [0, 0, 0, 0] \)).
  - \( endIndex \): Array of end indices (e.g., \( [0, 1, 2, 3] \)).
  - \( subs \): Array of allowed substitutions (e.g., \( [0, 1, 1, 0] \)).
- **Queries**:
  - For each query \( i \), extract the substring \( s[startIndex[i], endIndex[i]] \).
  - Check if the substring can be made a palindrome by changing at most \( subs[i] \) characters.
  - Return "1" if possible, "0" if not.
- **Example**:
  - \( s = "cdecd" \)
  - Query 1: \( s[0,0] = "c" \), \( subs[0] = 0 \). "c" is already a palindrome, so result = "1".
  - Query 2: \( s[0,1] = "cd" \), \( subs[1] = 1 \). Change "c" to "d" (or vice versa), making "dd", a palindrome, so result = "1".
  - Query 3: \( s[0,2] = "cde" \), \( subs[2] = 1 \). Changing one character (e.g., "e" to "c" or "c" to "e") cannot make "cdc" or "ede" a palindrome, so result = "0".
  - Query 4: \( s[0,3] = "cdec" \), \( subs[3] = 0 \). "cdec" is not a palindrome, and no substitutions are allowed, so result = "0".

### Approach
To determine if a substring can be made a palindrome with \( k \) substitutions:
1. A string is a palindrome if characters at symmetric positions (e.g., first and last, second and second-last) are the same.
2. Count the number of positions where characters differ in the substring.
3. To make it a palindrome, we need to change one character in each mismatched pair.
4. The number of changes needed is \( \text{number of mismatches} / 2 \) (rounded up if the length is odd).
5. If the number of changes needed is \( \leq subs[i] \), return "1"; otherwise, return "0".

### Java Solution
Here’s the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String[] canMakePalindrome(String s, int[] startIndex, int[] endIndex, int[] subs) {
        int n = startIndex.length;
        String[] result = new String[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int start = startIndex[i];
            int end = endIndex[i];
            int allowedSubs = subs[i];
            
            // Extract the substring
            String substring = s.substring(start, end + 1);
            
            // Count mismatches in the substring
            int mismatches = 0;
            int left = 0, right = substring.length() - 1;
            while (left < right) {
                if (substring.charAt(left) != substring.charAt(right)) {
                    mismatches++;
                }
                left++;
                right--;
            }
            
            // Number of changes needed is mismatches
            // If mismatches <= allowedSubs, we can make it a palindrome
            if (mismatches <= allowedSubs) {
                result[i] = "1";
            } else {
                result[i] = "0";
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String s = "cdecd";
        int[] startIndex = {0, 0, 0, 0};
        int[] endIndex = {0, 1, 2, 3};
        int[] subs = {0, 1, 1, 0};
        
        String[] result = sol.canMakePalindrome(s, startIndex, endIndex, subs);
        for (String res : result) {
            System.out.print(res + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Input Handling**:
  - The method \( canMakePalindrome \) takes the string \( s \), and arrays \( startIndex \), \( endIndex \), and \( subs \).
- **Query Processing**:
  - For each query \( i \), extract the substring using \( s.substring(startIndex[i], endIndex[i] + 1) \).
  - Use two pointers (\( left \) and \( right \)) to compare characters from both ends of the substring.
  - Count the number of positions where characters differ (\( mismatches \)).
- **Palindrome Check**:
  - To make a palindrome, we need to fix each mismatched pair by changing one character, so the number of changes needed is equal to the number of mismatches.
  - If \( mismatches \leq subs[i] \), we can make the substring a palindrome with the allowed substitutions.
- **Output**:
  - Return "1" if possible, "0" if not.
  - The result is stored in an array of strings.

### Output for the Example
- \( s = "cdecd" \)
- Query 1: \( s[0,0] = "c" \), \( subs[0] = 0 \), mismatches = 0, result = "1".
- Query 2: \( s[0,1] = "cd" \), \( subs[1] = 1 \), mismatches = 1, result = "1".
- Query 3: \( s[0,2] = "cde" \), \( subs[2] = 1 \), mismatches = 2, result = "0".
- Query 4: \( s[0,3] = "cdec" \), \( subs[3] = 0 \), mismatches = 1, result = "0".
- Final result: \( ["1", "1", "0", "0"] \).

### Time Complexity
- For each query, we process a substring of length up to \( |s| \).
- Checking if a substring can be a palindrome takes \( O(|s|) \) time.
- There are \( n \) queries, so the total time complexity is \( O(n \cdot |s|) \), where \( n \) is the number of queries and \( |s| \) is the length of the string.

### 2.  🧠 Problem Summary

* You are given `n` chocolates with weights: `weights[]`
* For `d` days, each day you:

  * Pick the chocolate with the **maximum weight**
  * Eat **half** of its weight: `floor(weight / 2)`
  * Keep the **remaining** portion back
* Objective: After `d` days, compute the **minimum total weight** left across all chocolates.

---

### ✅ Example:

Input:

```
weights = [30, 20, 25]
d = 4
```

#### Day-by-day:

* Day 1: pick 30 → eat 15 → push 15 back
* Day 2: pick 25 → eat 12 → push 13 back
* Day 3: pick 20 → eat 10 → push 10 back
* Day 4: pick 15 → eat 7 → push 8 back

**Final remaining weights**: 13, 10, 8
**Total = 13 + 10 + 8 = 31**

---

### 🛠️ Java Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ChocolateWeight {

    public static int minTotalWeight(int[] weights, int d) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        // Step 1: Add all chocolates into maxHeap
        for (int w : weights) {
            maxHeap.add(w);
        }

        // Step 2: For d days, eat half of the max and push the rest back
        for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
            int max = maxHeap.poll(); // largest weight
            int eaten = max / 2;
            int remaining = max - eaten;
            maxHeap.add(remaining);  // push remaining part back
        }

        // Step 3: Sum remaining chocolates
        int sum = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            sum += maxHeap.poll();
        }

        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {30, 20, 25};
        int d = 4;
        System.out.println("Minimum total weight after " + d + " days: " + minTotalWeight(weights, d));
    }
}
```

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity:

* **O(n + d log n)**

  * `n` to build the heap
  * `d` operations each taking `log n` for poll + add
