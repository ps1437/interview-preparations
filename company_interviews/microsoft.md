## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Triple Sum (3Sum)

### üîó Link: [3Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that:

- `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`
- `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ LRU Cache (Least Recently Used)

### üîó Link: [LRU Cache - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

**Problem Statement:**

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` initializes the LRU cache with a positive size.
- `int get(int key)` returns the value if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
- `void put(int key, int value)` updates or inserts the value. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, evict the least recently used item.
